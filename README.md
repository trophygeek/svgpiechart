- Each "slice" has inner and outer text.
- Data auto-saves into browser's localstorage, BUT you should download save data to restore it later or to share it with others.
- Drag and drop slices to reorder.
- Github action to build and deploy React site


## Development

Code show how to:
 - Use React input interactively with an SVG graphics component
 - Save an .svg file locally that was generated in javascrit without needing a server
 - rotate and center text in svg

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
